# Hi, I'm Maxime Martin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate **Developer** focused on **Machine Learning** and **Web Development**. I enjoy solving complex problems and building projects that have a real-world impact, such as **Sign Language Translation**.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- Developing a **Sign Language Recognition** web app that translates sign language into text. You can check it out here: [ASL Recognition](https://github.com/cosmos510/asl-recognition).
- Improving my skills in **Machine Learning**, especially with **Scikit-learn**, and refining my **Django** knowledge to build more advanced web applications.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- Advanced techniques in **Machine Learning** (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow).
- **Advanced Django** to better handle scalable and complex web applications.
- Soon, Iâ€™ll be diving into **JavaScript frameworks** to enhance my full-stack development capabilities.

## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- Projects involving **Machine Learning**, **Web Development**, and especially **Sign Language Recognition**.
- Open to collaborating with people interested in **AI**, **Web Development**, or **Machine Learning**.

## ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- **Deep Learning** models and improving performance in my Sign Language Translator.
- Advancing my knowledge in **front-end technologies** as I work with new JavaScript frameworks.
